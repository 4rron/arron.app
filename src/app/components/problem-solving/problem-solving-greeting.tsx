                Welcome to the section of my website where you learn all about
                my over-analytical side.
            </p>
            <p>
                I tend to dive head-first into a problem, learning anything and
                everything I can about it.
            </p>
            <p>
                Ask anybody who knows me or has ever worked on a project with
                me, and they'll attest that I tend to overemphasize the
                <i> right </i>
                way versus just getting something done.
            </p>
